# Automated Driving Skills 101

- Lectures at universities typically teach a lot of theory.
- When students start working in an internship, thesis, or full-time job, many practical skills are needed.
- This repository hosts a collection of resources that teach you those practical fundamentals that help you thrive in R&D of automated driving.


##  Know why you want to learn this material

Before you get started, it is important that you are aware of your motivation and ideally choose a certain goal. For example, you want to write a thesis on topic X or do an internship in the field Y, or you want to participate in an automated driving challenge/competition Z. Ideally, you have already put your hands on a practical project within automated driving, but noticed that you were lacking some fundamentals to make decent progress. This is the time to check out the following materials.

I recommend acquiring your skills in the following order.

## Source code skills

You typically start by learning the syntax of a higher-level programming language. The most common programming languages for automated driving are C++ and Python. 

## Basic tooling skills

Being able to produce good source code is not enough to get your project running. You should understand the Linux operating system, virtual machines, the command line, version control using Git and GitHub/GitLab, modern IDEs (integrated development environments), ROS (the robot operating system), and tooling specific to your programming languages such as CMake for building C++ code and package managers and virtual environments for Python projects.

## Actual automated driving skills 
With the previously covered skills, you can again dive deeper into what you actually want to do: automated driving. The typical topics of function development are sensing, perception, prediction, planning, control, and actuation. Furthermore, safety assurance and impact assessment are crucial for actually getting automated vehicles on the road. This also includes machine learning.


## Scientific skills
If you aim at writing a scientific thesis (Bachelor, Master, PhD), or publish scientific papers at conferences or journals, then all the "doing" skills are not enough. You should be able to identify knowledge gaps, learn critical scientific thinking, scitific writing, and detect non-scientific activities. After all, it is extremely helpful to know the degree to which the problem you are working on has already been solved in the literature. 

## Software project skills
Natually, your projects grow to a size where the source code and the architecture become messy, more and more bugs occur, and fixing one creates another. Therefore, you should learn to avoid those struggles and instead do what is necessary to let your project sustainably grow over multiple years. This includes writing clean code, implementing a clean architecture, using test-driven development, applying DevOps principles to your project, and using proper collaboration techniques.
