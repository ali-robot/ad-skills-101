# Automated Driving Skills 101

This repository collects resources that teach you the most essential fundamentals to thrive in R&D of automated driving. Our aim is to provide practical hands-on skills that theoretical university lectures often don't cover.

##  [Start your journey with a tangible goal](projects/Projects.md)

Ideally, you already desire mastering a certain practical project within automated driving, but notice that you are lacking some fundamentals to make decent progress. This is the perfect time to refresh your skills with the following materials. 

## Most essential: [Source code skills](source_code_skills/Source_code_skills.md)

You typically start by learning the syntax of a higher-level programming language. The most common programming languages for automated driving are [C++](source_code_skills/C++.md) and [Python](source_code_skills/Python.md). 


## Super essential: [Tooling skills for programming](basic_tooling_skills/Basic_tooling_skills.md)

Being able to produce good source code is not enough to get your project running. You should understand the Linux operating system, virtual machines, the command line, version control using Git and GitHub/GitLab, modern IDEs (integrated development environments), ROS (the robot operating system), and tooling specific to your programming languages such as CMake for building C++ code and package managers and virtual environments for Python projects.


## What you actually want: automated driving skills 
With the previously covered skills, you can again dive deeper into what you actually want to do: automated driving. The typical topics of function development are sensing, perception, prediction, planning, control, and actuation. Furthermore, safety assurance and impact assessment are crucial for actually getting automated vehicles on the road. This also includes machine learning.

## For your thesis or paper: scientific skills
If you aim at writing a scientific thesis (Bachelor, Master, PhD), or publish scientific papers at conferences or journals, then all the "doing" skills are not enough. You should be able to identify knowledge gaps, learn critical scientific thinking, scitific writing, and detect non-scientific activities. After all, it is extremely helpful to know the degree to which the problem you are working on has already been solved in the literature. 

## Managing the chaos: software project skills
Natually, your projects grow to a size where the source code and the architecture become messy, more and more bugs occur, and fixing one creates another. Therefore, you should learn to avoid those struggles and instead do what is necessary to let your project sustainably grow over multiple years. This includes writing clean code, implementing a clean architecture, using test-driven development, applying DevOps principles to your project, and using proper collaboration techniques.
