# Projects to work on

Studying is most effective if you have a goal mind. This goal could be building your own automated vehicle with your fellow students, acquiring the needed skills for a thesis or internship, or contributing to an open source driving function. 


## Student theses

Institutes of RWTH Aachen University who work on automated driving and related topics:

- [ika - Research Area Vehicle Intelligence & Automated Driving](https://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/en/education/students/student-theses/recent-topics/automated-driving-department.html)
- i11 (Computer Science)
- IRT
- WZL
- IGMR


## Internships

Too many companies to list!


## Student associations

At RWTH Aachen University: 

- Team Galaxis, the CaroloCup team: http://galaxis.rwth-aachen.de/
- Ecurie Aix, the formula student driverless team: https://ecurie-aix.de/


## Open source repositories

The following open source repositories might be interesting to contribute to as a student. 

As a beginner, you will hardly understand what these projects do and how they are developed, but if you actively use one of them for 1 or 2 years and acquire the skills described here, then you might be able to contribute something back.

- Autoware, an automated driving function:
  - based on ROS1: https://github.com/Autoware-AI
  - based on ROS2: https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto
- Apollo, another automated driving function: https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo
- CARLA, an automated driving simulation engine: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla
- ROS, the typical software framework for automated driving R&D: https://github.com/ros2
- Lanelet2, an HD map format for automated driving: https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2
