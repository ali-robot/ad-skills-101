# Source code skills

Universities usually teach at least one higher-level programming language to technical students. Try to take as much as possible from this course!

The most essential programming languages for automated driving are:

- C++ (harder to learn): for manually written code whose execution must be as fast as possible 
- Python (easier to learn): for training neural networks, prototyping, and many other things


Make sure to **start with only one language, but learn with that language in depth**. You can learn the other language when you know you will actually need it. 

In any case, you should cover basic syntax like functions, loops, and if-else, object-oriented design, and reading and writing from files.
