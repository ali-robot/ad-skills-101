# C++ 


Before you forget it: C++ is a *compiled* language! This means changes to your source code have NO effect on the execution of your program unless you 
- save your source code files
- build (preprocess, compile, and link) your code to an executable

Here are some resources you can use to get started:

| Link  | Type of Resource | Recommendation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| [C++ Programming All-in-One Tutorial Series (10 HOURS!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bYFu9mBnr4) | YouTube tutorial | Programming along with a YouTube tutorial might be more motivating to get started. Can anyone make a statement on the quality of this tutorial?  | 
| [w3schools.com/cpp](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp) | Very simple tutorial based on cloze (gap text)  | Use this to write the first C++ code on your own. |
| [cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)  | Good reading and illustrations about the most essential language concepts | Read up concepts here while implementing them somewhere else. |
| [C++ online IDE](http://cpp.sh/)  | An online editor to write, compile, and execute single-file C++ code. | You can use this for simplicity before switching to execution on your own computer. |
| [cplusplus.com/info](http://www.cplusplus.com/info) | Background knowledge about C++ | Read this after having gotten some practice |
