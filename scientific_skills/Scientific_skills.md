# :mortar_board: Scientific skills

If you aim at writing a scientific thesis (Bachelor, Master, PhD), or publish scientific papers at conferences or journals, then all the "doing" skills are not enough.
You should also acquire the following skills.


### :books: Literature research

#### Scientifically dealing with literature

In your studies so far, chances are that your literature resources were spoon-fed to you in the form of PowerPoint slides or lecture scripts.
When you start doing your own research, you have to find, manage, evaluate, and cite the relevant literature on your own.
You might be wondering which types of sources can, and if so, should be cited in a thesis in which way? What are the relevant differences between conference papers, journal articles, preprints, books, book chapters, other theses, news articles, blog entries, patents, repository readmes, project deliverables etc.?

The booklet [How to use, cite and reference literature effectively](https://wedc-knowledge.lboro.ac.uk/details.html?id=19409) by Loughborough University might be a great help for scientifically dealing with literature.
#### Search techniques

Some literature search techniques can reduce the chance of missing out important related work:
- **Keyword search**: Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) with well-chosen search strings
  - use operators such as `AND` and `OR` and `"quotation marks"` to better express what you are looking for
  - for more information, see e.g. [How to use Google Scholar](https://www.wur.nl/en/article/How-to-use-Google-Scholar.htm) by Wageningen University
- **Snowballing search** (see e.g. [Guidelines for Snowballing in Systematic Literature
Studies and a Replication in Software Engineering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2601248.2601268)):
  - The relevant literature that you already know is your start set
  - In iterations, perform:
    - forward snowballing: use the "Cited by" feature of Google Scholar to search through all works that have cited your already known relevant literature
    - backward snowballing: search through the bibliographies of your relevant literature

In practice, the time for literature research in your thesis might be too short to be able to rigorously apply these search techniques, but being aware of them hopefully helps you to bring some structure and objectivity into the otherwise pretty subjective search process.

#### Literature management tools

You should use a proper software to manage all your PDFs. These tools generate your list of references as needed by Word or Latex. Common choices are:
| Tool | Business model | Fidelity | Word/Latex | Supported Platforms |
| ---  | ---            | ---------| ---        | --------------      |
| [Citavi](https://www.citavi.com/de) | proprietary (available through RWTH) | advanced | Word and Latex | Web version; Desktop version for Windows |
| [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) | open-source | bare-bones | mostly Latex | Desktop versions for all platforms |

Other choices are [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager/), [Endnote](https://endnote.com/), or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).



### :brain: Critical and scientific reasoning

How to structure your methods according to  a logical argumentation? How to evaluate your findings critically? Interesting topics could be the difference between induction and deduction; or being able to distinguish correlation and causation in complicated situations. I know too little literature or course material about this to be able to recommend something, but I am curious about whether courses like this have been helpful to others.


###  :pencil: Scientific writing

Which wording is appropriate in a thesis? How to describe the state of the art? How to describe your own methods and results? Which sort of figures can support your message?

In your thesis, you are expected to demonstrate scientific writing skills no matter whether you have had formal education about it or not. To prepare for this, I can personally recommend:
- [Scientific Writing for Bachelor and Master Candidates](https://www.sz.rwth-aachen.de/cms/SZ/Schreibzentrum/Veranstaltungen/~lkmeu/Kurse-auf-Englisch/?lidx=1) (elective course of RWTH Aachen Language Center)
- [English for Writing Research Papers](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9781441979223) (Textbook)

### :microscope: How is science organized

Which respective roles do industry and academia play in R&D? Are the goals of fundamental and applied research different? Why is my individual research project funded at all? In applied research, where is the line between creation of public knowledge and regional economic support? In which way does the next election influence research funding? I argue that at least in automated driving today, answering these questions is crucial if you want to be aware of what you are doing within the greater context of society. 
I am wondering what is the best way to let students somehow deal with these topics because I am convinced it could give them more purpose and orientation in their otherwise very technical studies. 
Somewhat related to this, I was glad to hear that RWTH has introduced the online course "[Scientific Integrity](https://www.gdi.rwth-aachen.de/cms/GDI/Das-Lehr-und-Forschungsgebiet/Aktuelle-Meldungen/~kjvtr/Wissenschaftliche-Integritaet/?lidx=1)" as a prerequisite for students to begin their Master's theses. It appears to be covering the [Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice. Code of Conduct](https://zenodo.org/record/3923602#.YGgx_edCRPY) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Interestingly, I have not yet heard of such a compulsory course for PhD students.

### :shit: Recognizing pseudo-science

If common guidelines for good research practice are not followed, so-called Bullshit can happen. There has been a pretty informative course called [Calling Bullshit](https://www.callingbullshit.org/) at the University of Washington dealing with precisely this, and its lectures are available on YouTube. Topics include:
