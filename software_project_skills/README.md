# :brain: Software project skills

Naturally, your projects grow to a size where the source code and the architecture become messy, more and more bugs occur, and fixing one creates another. Therefore, you should learn to avoid those struggles and instead do what is necessary to let your project sustainably grow over multiple years.

### Clean code

If you know the pain of having to use someone else's dirty code or even your own code from some time ago, then you might be motivated to learn how to write clean code. The most essential rules are:
- Use *descriptive names* for variables, functions, classes, files etc. Ideally, all your naming tell such a self-explaining story that you hardly need any comments anymore.
- Use *short functions and classes*: they should be responsible for one thing, and do that thing well. Having such small building blocks facilitates re-assembling and re-using them.
- Have a *consistent level of abstraction* to keep the overview: e.g., calling your most important high-level function should not happen in between some detailed string manipulations.

### Clean architecture




### Documenting your project

As you might have noticed in this repository, I am a big fan of Markdown files (`.md`) because their contents can be tracked in Git, they are easy to write, and they render beautifully in both GitHub and GitLab.




### Test-driven development


### Containerization


### Continuous integration (CI)



### Collaboration tools and techniques.
